No outside help / other teams we're consulted. How to debug SML type errors finally seems to make sense, understanding operator vs. operand and how to use it in the context of the types expected by our defined structures and datatypes to help guide working on a problem. Apologies for the ugliness of the solutions to map and filter - they we're very much experimentally developed, but hey they work and conceptually we understand what they're doing but suspect there may be much more elegant solutions.
